# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The goal is to build a dynamic web-page that displays UFOs sightings information for upcoming annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts in McMinnville, Oregon. Due to the extensive amount of data to display, I have created filters to refine a users search. The dynamic web-page contains the following:

- Attention-grabbing header and a refresh-page button.
- Overview of article summary.
- Interactive filters for searching criteria based on date, city, country and shape.
