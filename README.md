# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The goal is to build a dynamic web-page that displays UFOs sightings information for upcoming annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts in McMinnville, Oregon. Due to the extensive amount of data to display, I have created filters to refine a users search. The dynamic web-page contains the following:

- Attention-grabbing header and a refresh-page button.
- Overview of article summary.
- Interactive filters for searching criteria based on date, city, country and shape.

## Results

The dynamic webpage allows the user to filter various preferences to load their search results. This interactive webpage is very intuitive to find results.

The user can also refresh the webpage and filter new results by simply clicking the top left button labeled "UFO Sightings".

## Summary

The dynamic webpage accepts user inputs and produces results to reflect the users query. While this process is easy and intuitive, it does have some drawbacks and there are potential reccomendations to improve the overall process.

#### Drawbacks

- The reset button is hard to notice and far away from the filters.
- All the search data is dsplayed together and it could be overwhelming for the user to understand.

#### Recommendations

- Moving the reset button closer to the filters could be helpful for the user to see and exercise. Labeling it as a "refresh" button could be even more helpful.
- Add a dropdown in the search filter boxes that the users can see and select specific data for the filtered fields. This could help users see what to look for as well.
